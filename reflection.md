Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 
I started this too late and didn't finish it quite in time(I also though it was due a day later) so I couldn't get all the functionality in on the first go through. Once I finished it off though I don't think it was too difficult, I just had trouble initially understanding what I was supposed to do. The refurbish function tripped me up a bit because I didn't understand why it was included. I also got a bit confused about how to put it onto gradescope but I figured it out.

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Don't procrastinate so much, if you start it won't be as bad as you expect
