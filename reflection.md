Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 
I started this too late and didn't finish it in time(I also though it was due a day later) so I couldn't get all the functionality in on the first go through.

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Don't procrastinate so much, if you start it won't be as bad as you expect
